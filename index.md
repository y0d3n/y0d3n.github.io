## About

### Origin of the name "y0d3n"
My real name is Yoda. In Kanji, write "養田".
"養" is read as "Yo-". And "田" reads "da".
There are several ways to read Kanji, and "田" can be read as "den".
So I named it "yoden". However, the TwitterID "yoden" was used :(
So I made "y0d3n" using leet for vowels!
